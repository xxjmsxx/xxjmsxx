🚀 Current Work
At Endpoint, I build and maintain systems that transform synthetic healthcare data into actionable insights. From fullstack Rails APIs to Python pipelines and agentic LLM infrastructure, my work blends classical engineering with cutting-edge machine learning.

I designed a Knowledge-Augmented Generation (KAG) system that uses vector embeddings to retrieve the most relevant nodes from a biomedical knowledge graph, filters database entities by semantic mappings (e.g., chemo, neuro), and orchestrates LLM queries using Python-generated DataFrame operations. This system answers complex medical queries while remaining explainable and traceable.

🛠️ Recent Projects

Built an LLM-powered pipeline that interprets structured synthetic cohort data and generates precise multi-step Pandas queries.

Led API design for partner-facing endpoints in our synthetic data platform.

Developed fast, memory-efficient RAG replacements to support lightweight deployment scenarios.

🌱 Past & Passion Projects
I also care deeply about user-centered tools—like a React/Rails app that helps people like my mom track their houseplants. My work is driven by curiosity and emotional impact, not just technical polish.

☕ Fun Fact
I’m one of the few devs who don’t drink coffee—chocolate milk is my fuel of choice.

🎶 Backstory
Originally from the UK and raised in Germany, I started in music before discovering coding through the Le Wagon Berlin bootcamp. My artistic background still shows up in how I design systems: clear, expressive, and human-first.
